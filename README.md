# Minecraft XIV

Adds an upgraded third-person perspective inspired by Final Fantasy XIV.

## Vanilla-friendly features

- Free camera rotation
- Zoom in and out with scroll wheel or keybinds
- Make player transparent when camera is too close
- Choose between camera-relative or player-relative movement
- Pick blocks with the mouse cursor

## Extra stuff

Minecraft XIV also includes some additional features that only be enabled on servers with the mod installed, such as:

- Directly target blocks with the mouse cursor, bypassing player line-of-sight checks
- Target any block you can see, ignoring player reach
